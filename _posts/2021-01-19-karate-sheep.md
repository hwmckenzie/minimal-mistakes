Hi,

All continues in the regular routine here at the property. The sheep were feeling feisty today. Several times when I looked out they were engaging in head butting and shoving. There is one sheep who has a funny habit of raising her front leg in a kicking motion. What she means by it I have no idea! Maybe I should let them out tomorrow so they can do a circuit of our yard for some mental stimulation.

I will be attending Clicker Expo online the last weekend in January. This is a big conference about animal training, focused on positive training where you reward behaviours you want instead of punishing behaviours you don't want. This is just one training philosophy, but a handy one when the animal you are training is not easily reprimanded for bad behaviour. Like tigers or whales, or sheep! While I am primarily attending because of my interest in dog training, I was excited to see that they have sessions about all sorts of animals. There is even a session about training shy and skittish animals where they will be doing a demo with alpacas! Perhaps I will learn some tips to make headway with the sheep after all.

It is getting quite windy here so I better finish up and get this posted soon in case we lose power. Hopefully we don't lose anything else to the wind! The dogs are not impressed, though no one has retreated to the bathroom yet.

Today's photo is of the chickens enjoying the play structure that Chris has set up for them and the mild weather.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
