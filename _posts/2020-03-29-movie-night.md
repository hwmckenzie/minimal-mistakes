Hello!

Despite the current need to self-isolate and social distance, tonight Chris and I got to enjoy a night at the movies! Thanks to Sandy (Chris's Dad), we are the proud owners of a portable mini projector. So, tonight after dinner we said goodbye to the dogs and took the projector, our bluetooth speaker, the couch cushions, and some wine and cookies to the office shed to enjoy the movie/ documentary The Biggest Little Farm. Overall it was a big success, and we plan to have future movie nights. The movie was also quite good, though it was a bit overwhelming to see what the main characters were able to do with their farm... and how many hardships, heartbreaks, sweat and tears it cost them to get there. All things we wish we could do at our place, but find it hard to imagine how. All we could think is that they must have had an angel investor with deep pockets, or a lot of patience! If any of my dear readers are looking to to invest in a budding farm in east-central Alberta, don't hesitate to get in touch. We currently specialize in dogs, caragana and pigeons, but we are open to expansion!

Today's photo is of yours truly getting ready for the movie. I hope everyone is well, I think of you all everyday.

Lots of hugs,
Hannah
