Hi,

Another day of virtual conferencing, though I did skip one session in the afternoon and found it made quite a difference to how alert I felt by the end of the day. I think I will do the same tomorrow. During the "free" time, in addition to doing a bit of yoga to realign my spine, I cleaned out the straw from the bat shed and closed the door. Since the sheep aren't using it, we figured we better close it up before something else moves in. There are some shady characters in the neighborhood! I put the straw from the shed where they are currently laying, as well as in front of the sheep shed... just in case. Chris and I watched the last conference session of today together. It was about working with shy and skittish animals, and now we have lots of great ideas about how to work with the sheep. I think I'll wait for warmer weather to try it though! But, maybe we will be able to touch them sometime this summer. Hope springs eternal!

Today's photo is of another black lab from my past. This is Sabie, my first dog. I think of her everyday as I have a photo frame on my dresser with photos of her as a puppy, in her prime, and as senior. I came across some other photos of her last night while looking for a photo of Spike and decided she would get to be the star tonight. She was a very good dog who had a few bad moments. In particular I remember her dragging me at the end of the leash through the garden and down the driveway while I was face first on the ground, and also that she used to drive my mother to distraction by going walk-about late at night when everyone should have been in bed.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
