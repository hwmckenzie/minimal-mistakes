Good evening!

The dogs, Chris and I had a good and somewhat full Saturday. We started as usual with a dog walk. Shortly after arriving home there was a mini snow blizzard. As I was standing at the kitchen sink enjoying the snow and washing dishes, I was privy to the courtship ritual of two grouse! The female arrived on scene first and hopped up onto a small bush. The male, tail feathers splayed out and feathers around his neck standing up like a collar ran from the nearby trees towards the bush, paced around the bush, and then stood at the bottom of the bush, shaking his neck feathers! It was quite impressive! There may have been accompanying vocalizations, but we couldn't tell. Chris did try to get a photo, but his efforts to take a photo on his phone through the binoculars (a nifty trick he has used successfully in the past) were to no avail. The pair stayed there for a while, and next time I happened to look up, I caught a glimpse of the female disappearing into the forest, the male in hot pursuit! Such intrigues!

We also took down our Christmas lights, tidied some of the things that always seem to accumulate around our house, finished cleaning out the bird boxes, and went about our various regular daily activities involving the dogs, cooking, laundry, and things on our computers.

Today's photo features Revi submitting to the "Paw Plunger", a recently acquired product we are hoping will help with the upcoming mud season. Despite still having quite a bit of snow, Revi and Sadie returned from one of their forays in the yard today with muddy paws, so we were quite excited to have the opportunity to try out the paw plunger. Sadly, initial results were underwhelming, though we hold out hope that there might be room for improvement by filling it fuller with water and using different plunging techniques such as swishing and swirling. While Revi and Sadie humored us by having all their paws plunged, I suspect they will probably have a dog conference later to discuss what should be done about this new house-entering ritual.

Hugs,
Hannah
