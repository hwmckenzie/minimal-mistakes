Hi,

Hard to believe we only have one more day of Christmas vacation. I think everyone around here is feeling a little bit sad about that and wishing we had a few more days. But, we took down the tree and put away the decorations today, so it is onward. Time to start thinking about this summer's garden!

The chickens enjoyed a very nice day as it was warm and sunny. Minutes after Chris opened their coop this morning they were congregated under the bird feeder and spent the rest of the day wandering around and exploring. They don't realize it, but they are very lucky to live with dogs. At one point this afternoon all three dogs rushed off the deck and down to the bottom of the yard. As I ran out to see what was going on, I just caught the shape of a coyote running away. If the dogs hadn't been outside I expect we might be a chicken short tonight. As it is, the chickens are laying quite well, even though it is winter and we don't use any supplemental light. There are two "broody" chickens who try their best to guard the eggs from Chris when he goes to collect them. However, they aren't entirely committed as they go up to the roost at night, so we get a chance to gather the eggs. At the moment all the chickens have abandoned the nest boxes I built for them and are laying their eggs at the back of the coop under their poop board. While this is a very private area, it is hard for Chris and I to access, so I foresee some minor coop rearrangement in the near future.

Today's photo is of the chickens looking for snacks in one of my garden beds. This one was only newly discovered by them today, so it caused quite the excitement.

Hugs,
Hannah
