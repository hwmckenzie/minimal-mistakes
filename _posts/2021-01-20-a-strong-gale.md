Hi,

Today was all about the wind and the return of winter. Or at least, we did get a little snow, but got to enjoy very mild temperatures. However, there was nothing mild about the wind! At one point last night I almost decided we should go sleep downstairs in case the spruce tree outside decided to test out how strong our roof was. While the dogs and I were disturbed by the wind, Chris slept well as he is an avid earplug user. This morning I was convinced there would be a lot of trees down, and maybe even some damage to our barn or tent garage, but in the end the only casualty was our wooden blue bird weather vane. I hope it can be repaired. It is very cheery and I look at it everyday, spinning away outside our kitchen window.

I think the sheep may have tested out the shed today. When I went down tonight to refill their water and take them some oats, Bold Sheep was actually standing in the shed looking out and Spray Paint was in the straw bale foyer! The other three silly sheep (Alarm Sheep, Karate Sheep, and No Name Yet Sheep) were hovering on the other side of the shed. I bet they want to try it out, but just haven't worked up the courage yet. 

Today's photo is of something we came across on our walk this evening. It was actually the second mushroom I noticed in a tree on the walk. Someone's snack for later I guess. Hopefully they remember where they put it!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
