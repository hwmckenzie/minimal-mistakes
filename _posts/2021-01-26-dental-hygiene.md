Hi,

A short note tonight as I promised (warned?) Sadie that I would brush her teeth before bed. I have been trying to do this nightly since she had her last teeth cleaning and we have been pretty consistent. But, I missed last night, so I must get us back on track. In fact she is coming over now, so I best get my dentist hat on!

Today's photo is of the sheep a few days ago during one of their outings in our larger yard. They continue to shun all creature comforts and choose a low spot in the field over the various shelter options we offer them. Clearly they are fine!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
