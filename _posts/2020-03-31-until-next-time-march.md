Good evening!

As today draws to a close, so does the month of March. Upon reflection, I do not feel the old adage of "in like a lion, out like a lamb" held true this year. My recollection of early March was of breathing a sigh of relief as the frigid air of late January finally blew off to freeze some poor souls elsewhere. Some of the more optimistic among us may even have begun to dream about gardens and warm summer nights. Well, last night this particular optimist was informed by her loving husband that there are no daytime highs above -10C in the forecast for the foreseeable future, and she woke up this morning to a foot of snow! Luckily lions, while toothy, are magnificent beasts, and so was the sun which shone at full strength today on our fresh blanket of snow.

We refilled the bird feeders before heading off on our walk this morning as we weren't the only ones hoping for warmer weather. We have started seeing some different birds over the last little while and it is exciting to imagine birds everywhere making their way to summer homes. We have seen several pine siskins, a flock of waxwings, blue jays, and today the first junco. A day ago the junco would have found lots of seeds on the ground thanks to a hairy woodpecker who is a regular visitor to our feeder. We have nicknamed him "swishy" due to his habit of using his beak to swish all the seeds onto the ground in search of some particular seed of choice, or maybe just for fun! Now the seeds are deep under snow and our poor junco was left to swim through the white stuff while foraging on the ground.

Today's photo is another great one courtesy of Chris. He took it on our morning walk, just at the moment the sun came over the trees to cast its warm light across the snowy field. Almost makes a person think another month of winter would be alright. Almost.

Hugs, and see you in April!
