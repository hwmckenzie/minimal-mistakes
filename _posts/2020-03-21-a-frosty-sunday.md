Hello!

With things being quite out of the ordinary, I found myself craving some good old ordinary human contact, and I figured others might feel the same. So, I decided to start sending a daily email to the people I care about who are far away, with a picture and a few sentences about something that happened. I'll admit this is a group email (I am no Martha Stewart after all!), but hopefully the thought will count for enough to overcome this slightly less personalized medium! So, without further ado, the first installment!

This morning we enjoyed a bright, sunny, blue-sky, and frosty spring,dog walk. The dogs are now napping in various sunbeams around the house and Chris and I are catching up on our respective computer tasks. I am feeling optimistic that the long overdue February post for the Property Report blog will be completed and posted later today. Today's photo is of the spruce trees by our front door. They are ready for spring on the bottom, but holding on to winter on the top!

Many hugs,
Hannah
