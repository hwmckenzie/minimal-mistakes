Hi,

We continue to make adjustments and sacrifices to try to smooth the transition from mild to cold winter for our animals. My sacrifice last night was that I woke up every hour to check the temperature in the coop to make sure it wasn't plummeting. Chris's sacrifice was that he had to put up with a grumpy Hannah this morning! Chris made popcorn for the chickens today to put in a bird feeder we hung in the coop. They were excited about it, but not quite as excited as when we toss it on the ground for them to chase. I also opened up the bat shed and put some straw in there for the sheep. So now they have another option for getting out of the wind. There was a good deal of curious and hesitant staring in the door, and repeat visits, but so far no one has been brave enough to go in. Tonight I put their oats in there, so perhaps that will tip the scales. It was funny to watch them check it out. Bold Sheep would go up to the door and sniff and try to look in. Then the others would start coming up behind her, like "are we going in there?"... and after a bit she'd be like "nope" and walk away, and they'd all be like "nope, nope, nope!" and follow her. Just like, well, sheep! However, I think animals and humans alike are starting to adjust to the cold. When I went out tonight to check the sheep and make sure they had enough hay, I came back in and I told Chris that it wasn't actually that bad outside. So maybe I won't be writing about the weather again tomorrow!

Today's photo is of our handsome rooster posing on the shelf under the window. One of his favourite places. I thought the rooster and I were friends after he ate scratch from my hand, but we did have a bit of a set-to the other day. He was eying me up from his shelf perch while I was helping Chris in the coop. And then he pecked me! So I scooped him up, a maneuverer which entailed hanging on to his leg while he flapped in an effort to escape, before I got him squeezed to my chest. This action caused a short outburst of chaos in the coop, and was not approved by the chicken whisperer (Chris). Then we just stood there for a bit, with me holding him, and his ladies watching attentively from the roost. I had read on the internet that one way to show a rooster who is boss is to carry him around in front of the hens. They seemed suitably impressed. I'm not sure what he was thinking. He did struggle a bit a one point, but I just hugged him until he stopped. Eventually I put him back down and he walked off. I haven't been back in the coop since, so I'm not sure what effect my lesson had. He is still less than a year old, so perhaps he is going through an adolescent phase of sorts. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
