Hi,

In this case, the second time was the charm. After all our work yesterday, the chickens rewarded us by laying eight eggs. Better yet, all eight eggs were in the nest boxes, and they made use of three of the four boxes. I think our newest design must be a winner! The only slight concern is that there was a ninth egg, but it was broken and in the middle of the coop. Hopefully we don't have an egg-eater on our hands. Chris though that maybe the rooster was particularly interested in the eggs he collected. Perhaps simple curiosity, or maybe a guilty conscience? Hopefully it was nothing and the saga of the eggs can be laid to rest, at least for a few days!

I also spent some more time today with my permaculture book. I posted an introductory post on the [Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com). I am planning for the next post to be a bit more "meaty".

Today's photo is the gift Chris received from the Camerons' white elephant gift exchange that we did over Christmas. For this gift exchange all gifts had to be virtual, because it was 2020! Chris ended up with a piece of digital art of his choice, so of course he chose the dogs. I love it!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
