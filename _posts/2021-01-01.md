Happy New Year everyone!

Chris and I are having a bit of a hard time believing it is really 2021... 2021 seems like a year you would expect to be very futuristic, but now it is here! Being a new year, I have started to consider the topic of resolutions. I haven't settled on any, but I have recently been thinking that perhaps instead of resolving to do something this year, I might resolve not to do something instead. There is something about the psychology of not doing something which makes me wonder if that kind of resolution will be easier to keep!

To celebrate the new year we went for a big dog walk this morning over to the Ducks Unlimited property. Our first time there in several years. The dogs were quite excited by all the new smells and deer tracks. Chris has recently taken charge of Revi on our walks and she kept him quite busy. However, we did return with all the dogs, so we are off to a good start this year. Our walks have also taken on a new meaning. Revi recently got a replacement Tractive (a little device that tracks her location and provides us some assistance in recovering her when she goes on solo adventures) and this new model also tracks her minutes of activity. It restarts each month and currently she is number 1 on the local dog leaderboard! Since for the most part Revi is active when we are active, if we want her to stay in top place we will need to up our walking game. 

In addition to now posting my daily updates on this blog instead of delivering them to your inboxes, I am going to start publishing The Property Report again. Over the next little while I will be writing posts for the months of 2020 that I missed, summarizing the main events in those months, hopefully with a fresh perspective. Since I am also planning to continue with the dailies, I will do something slightly different for 2021 with the Property Report. I am going to use the monthly Property Report posts to talk about our progress towards applying the practice of permaculture to our property. 

Today's photo is from our evening dog walk. It was a bit overcast, but still some nice colors.

Hugs,
Hannah
