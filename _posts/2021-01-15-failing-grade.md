Hi,

Well, the reviews are in. While initial feedback seemed positive (the chickens laid nine eggs today!), a closer look at the data suggests we missed the mark (the eggs were all over the coop). Not one of the eggs was in the nest boxes. So, back to the drawing board. I have a few ideas and hopefully we can get something acceptable set up for them this weekend.

Today's photo is again from our evening walk. Apparently I am in a "tree" phase!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
