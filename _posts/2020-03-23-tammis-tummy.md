Greetings!

This morning began quite suddenly for me, when the sounds of a dog in distress and imminently about to vomit rudely pushed their way into my slumber. Unfortunately I did not make it down the ladder in time to let Tammi out, but she still enjoyed some fresh air before returning to her couch while I cleaned up. The culprit was some bone chips ingested while gnawing on one of the various bones she has brought back from the woods and stashed around our yard. With tomorrow morning in mind, the first order of business after returning from our walk was to throw out all the bones I could find. All good things must come to an end!

Today's photo is of a tree we came across on our walk this morning. Many trees show signs of woodpecker activity, but this one really appeared to be somebody's home instead of somebody's restaurant. We didn't see anyone home at the time, but we plan to check back regularly. We have many birds come to our feeders and I often wonder where on earth they all live! It is a part of their life they haven't shared with us yet, but that I am very curious about.

Hugs!
Hannah
