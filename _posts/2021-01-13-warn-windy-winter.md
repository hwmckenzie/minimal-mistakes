Hi,

We had some weather here today. When I first woke up, all was calm. By the time we left for our dog walk, the deck had been transformed into a skating rink. Luckily it was only raining a little and it was quite a nice walk. After I made the coffee and sat down at my desk, the wind rose and snow started blowing. Late in the morning I looked up from my computer to see a bit of a chicken gathering. The problem, I realized after watching for a few minutes, was that they had been out enjoying themselves, but with the wind rising had come around through the yard and found the gate to their pen closed. In an effort to get his hens out of the blowing snow, the rooster was calling them over to the abandoned summer coop. As it was closed, they were all milling around it in a fluster. One hen, apparently spotting appropriate shelter at the other end of the yard starting making off over the snow in a decided manner. Before they could get into any more trouble, I hustled outside with some scratch to open their gate. Everyone heard me, or least the scratch, coming and came running. A few minutes later I looked out to see a flock of fluffy chicken butts, their owners happily scratching at the ground in search of tasty treats. Another few minutes and everyone had retreated into the coop, where they enjoyed the rest of the day out of the wind. Even the sheep might have used their shed today. Tomorrow morning when I go down to refill their water I will look for evidence of habitation.

For the last few weeks I have been revisiting Canadian history, but from an Indigenous perspective. Something I did not learn about in school. The University of Alberta offers a free online course called Indigenous Canada, and I highly recommend it to everyone. As part of the course, the university commissioned six pieces of artwork by Leah Dorion, a Metis artist from Prince Albert. Each piece focuses on a major theme in the course, and Leah provides an explanation of the stories and symbols within each. For a taste of the course you can check out the stories behind the artwork [here](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/indigenous-canada/artwork.html).

Today's photo is from our evening walk. It isn't very clear in the photo, but all the trees were painted with snow on one side.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
