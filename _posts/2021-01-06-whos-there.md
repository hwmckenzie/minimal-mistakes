Hi,

Our chickens had a bit of an exciting day today. With all the warm weather over the last few weeks, they have really been enjoying their time outside, and have been expanding their range. After the dogs scared off the coyote a few days ago, I have been on moderate alert to respond to chicken hulabaloos. It would be difficult to be on high alert as they do sometimes carry on over nothing. Anyway, this afternoon the rooster was giving his alarm call with enough gusto that I went out to see what was going on and Chris came running from his office as well. We found the rooster under the kitchen window, calling like his hens were in imminent danger. They must have listened to him and run for cover as no hens were to be seen. At first we couldn't see what was causing his concern, but then Chris spotted it. Of course it took me a few minutes longer, the binoculars, and a verbal description of how to see it. I've never been good with finding things at a distance by following someone's pointing finger! So, now that you have experienced the suspense I felt... it was a barred owl! Chris got a photo through the binoculars. It was very impressive, and didn't seem very bothered by us watching it. It did eventually fly off, in complete. Hopefully it will find sufficient mice and other small animals that it doesn't bother coming back for our chickens. A good job by our rooster to alert his hens and us. After he tried to take on Chris I did check to see if he had any spurs. All he has are small nubs at the moment, so I'm not sure how he would fare against an owl. I do think he has a certain self-assurance though that engenders respect, from the dogs at least. I've observed that they give him a wide berth.

Today's photo is of the owl.

Hugs,<br />
