Hi,

There was a bit of disappointment on the walk this morning. Revi decided to take a solo adventure and her little light disappeared into the dark, not to re-emerge for some time. When we stopped to check where she was on the Tractive app, we realized with dismay that her battery was dead so we weren't able to track her. Worse still, she was not able to log her activity minutes! Revi did rejoin us on our way home, just as we were waiting for the road grader to pass of course, which was a bit stressful. But sadly we were not able to recover her minutes. However, I did take the dogs on longer walk this evening, and through some good luck she is in third place on the local dog leaderboard! Phew! Revi is concerned that we are not feeding her enough to sustain her competitive edge, and she might have a point as she is quite slim and also stole some food off our coffee table the other day, which she has never done before. Time to increase her rations!

Otherwise, not too much of note occurred today, which gives me the opportunity to share some chicken math that Chris has recently worked out. Since April 24, 2020 when the first chickens arrived, we have spend the following on chickens:

Housing - $2,107.44 (summer and winter coop construction)</br>
Supplies - $626.49 (includes the cost of the chickens!)</br>
Food - $223.40

For a grand total of $2,957.33. In the same time the chickens have laid 1,009 eggs. This means we've been paying $2.93/egg or $35.16/dozen. Those are some boutique eggs! Chris also tracks his time, so he knows he spent 155 hours on chicken-related tasks. If we pay him at a rate of $15/hr, that ups the per egg cost to $5.23. I have no idea how much time I have spend on chicken chores, but suffice to say it is a lot! However, as I took paid vacation days for all my coop building, I suppose we can consider that the Government of Alberta paid for the majority of my wages. Lucky for the chickens! This way they won't be passing on as much debt to future generations. However, they do provide us with endless entertainment and are very sociable (unlike some other farm tenants!), so maybe it is not all about the numbers in the end.

Today's photo is from this morning as we returned from the dog walk.

Hugs,</br>
Hannah
