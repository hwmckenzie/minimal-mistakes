Hi,

It did warm up a bit today, but somehow I was hoping to feel more of a difference! Not warm enough yet to let the chickens out though, particularly considering their history of poor life choices in cold weather! However, the coop inhabitants are getting a bit restless and could use a change of scenery. Despite our efforts to provide some enrichment, there has been an increase in feather picking. Hence the poor hen we had to keep inside overnight a few days ago. In an effort to prevent further descent towards cannibalism, we picked up a product called "Stop-Pick" from our farm supply store. It is a horrendously smelling bright red concoction including aloes, gentian, and juniper tar (to sooth the skin of the victim) and cayenne pepper (to repel the attacker). A bit odd that it is red, since chickens like to peck things that are red, but maybe that is to lure them in all the better to teach them a lesson? Anyway, results so far are mixed. The picking continues, but at least there are no puncture wounds as of yet.

Today's photo is again from last January. It is of Revi demonstrating how fun walks are, even in cold weather!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
