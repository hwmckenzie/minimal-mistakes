Hi,

All the animals have things to report on today. 

Starting with the chickens. It warmed up enough today that they were able to go outside for the first since Saturday (Jan 23)! I'm not sure if everyone took advantage, but at least several made the trip to the front step. These we had to convince to head back to the coop as we didn't want to risk any frostbite. Hopefully this little break will improve coop relations!

The sheep also got to wander a bit further afield in the morning as I let them out into the yard. Mostly they just hung out on the trail that goes to the back gate. At one point, Spray Paint laid down in the middle of the trail to take in some sun. A little while later I saw the other sheep all huddled together a little further down the trail as if they were having a conference. Likely trying to figure out how to bypass Spray Paint!

The dogs wanted to make sure I recorded that they got the short end of the stick tonight, as I did yoga instead of taking them for a second walk. The audacity! So while I tried to breath deeply, bend and fold, and become zen, they played in the yard. This involves a lot of horrible noises which would make you think animals were dying if you didn't know better. Then they would come in, start playing inside, and be sent back outside by Chris, who was trying to preserve some sense of peace for my yoga class. Thank goodness we practice on mute! 

Today's photo is of the sheep enjoying one of the topographic features of our yard. This little hill is fondly named "mud mountain" as it is a pile of heavy clay and dirt that was leftover from our house construction and never really got flattened. It is a favourite with the dogs as well. Maybe we will re-purpose mud mountain as part of my property design. Revi will be heartbroken as she likes to lay atop it amongst the weeds in summer evenings and gaze out across the yard.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
