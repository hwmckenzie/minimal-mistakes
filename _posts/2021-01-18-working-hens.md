Hi,

As I write this we have three chickens in our bathtub. We seem to have another wave of pasty butt going around. We brought these three in tonight for a wash and they are currently drying before we put them back in the coop for the night. I like that our current system does not require keeping any chickens inside overnight. Much cleaner and it means we don't have to do any re-integration. We are going to try to feed them some yogurt tomorrow as my reading suggests that pasty butt is an imbalance in the fauna of their digestive or reproductive tract. The ladies weren't the only ones getting some attention. We also put some polysporin and udder butter (exactly what it sounds like!) on the rooster's comb as he had a few scabby spots which I think were frost-bite related. They are healing now, but I figured a little bit of help wouldn't hurt. He was quite well-behaved. They are very docile once they go to bed at night.

You may be thinking this is a lot of fuss over some chicken butts. It is true that Chris and I don't like to see any of our animals suffer... and it also so happens that our chickens are now working hens! In an effort to make room in our fridge and not end up with high cholesterol ourselves, we posted on the Innisfree facebook group in search of a few new egg customers. As of tonight the chickens have a total of four customers! So, we need to make sure everyone is in good health to meet the demand. Chris has secured the domain name "propertychicks.ca", so our chickens will soon be online once we get their website up and running. 

Today's photo is from our evening walk. The sinking sun was lighting up the tops of the trees so they almost seemed to be on fire. And I even managed to get two of the dogs in this one!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
