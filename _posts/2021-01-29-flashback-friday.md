Hi,

Not too much news from today. This weekend, including today, I am attending Clicker Expo, a virtual dog training conference. While the dogs may benefit in the long run, they are definitely losing in the short term. I spent the whole day in front of my computer (very boring by their standards) and there was no evening walk for the second day in a row. I expect rebellion tomorrow! After my experience today I have decided to take one session off tomorrow so I can move around a bit more to make sure the blood keeps circulating. Otherwise by Sunday night I will just be a puddle on the floor! The sessions so far have been interesting and I've learned lots of new things. Chris and I are looking forward to the last session of tomorrow which is about training fearful and skittish animals. It turns out we have five of those!

Today's photo is a bit of a flashback. For some reason this morning I was thinking about our black lab, Spike. So I decided he would get to star in the photo. Here he is in 2015 at the cabin at Lake Wabamun. Chris lived there that summer with Spike and Sadie, while Seuss and I traveled back and forth from stints sniffing boats in Vermilion. All the dogs enjoyed that summer and lake life quite a bit, although Spike never went swimming. Despite his genetics it just wasn't his thing!

Hugs,<br \>
Hannah
