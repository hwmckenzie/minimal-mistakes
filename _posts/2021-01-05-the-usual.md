Hi,

As I contemplate this empty page, it seems not too much of particular note happened today!

With the warm weather we have quite a lot of bird action. All the regulars are here including chickadees, nuthatches, hairy and downy woodpeckes, and redpolls. This year we also have a red-breasted nuthatch. Previously all our nuthatches were white-breasted, which is interesting as these are actually the less common type for our area. We also have a group of blue jays that come around sometimes. We have been waiting for them to stop by as we put out some peanuts specially for them, but so far they haven't arrived. Although the level of shells in the feeder has not gone down, I think the woodpeckers have been pecking holes in the shells and stealing the nuts. So, if and when the blue jays arrive they might be in for some disappointment!

Today's photo is of Sadie enjoying her double-decker dog bed. She looks pretty comfy!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
