Hi there!

It was a good Sunday at our place today. The main event today was that I cooked Eggplant and Lentil Lasagna ([link](https://minimalistbaker.com/lentil-eggplant-lasagna/ "https://minimalistbaker.com/lentil-eggplant-lasagna/")). This dish is very tasty, but not to be undertaken when you want a quick dinner! I had a few realizations while making it this time around. First, I used to think that salting your eggplant was an unnecessary step. Apparently salting helps reduce any bitterness in the taste. I am not sure if this is true, but now I salt my eggplant. Perhaps this is a sign of maturity? Second, this dish calls for a filling of "ricotta tofu". Somehow, I decided at the store this meant I should buy ricotta cheese AND tofu. It was only when consulting the recipe at the critical step of adding the ricotta to see how much was needed, that I determined in fact zero ricotta was needed... it is a vegan dish and the tofu IS the ricotta!
