Hi,

So, it got cold today. Quite cold! This day last weekend we did a big clean of the chicken coop and roasted hot dogs over the fire. Not so today! Today was the polar opposite, emphasis on the "polar"! Today we went for two short dog walks, did our animal chores, and otherwise enjoyed the winter sun from inside. Hopefully I will adjust quickly and get my Alberta winter mojo back because things look quite frosty for the next week at least. One thing that did help was the arrival of my new work uniform parka. I figure if I am walking Seuss, that counts as work, so I tested it out today. While I can't say it is flattering, a big bulky coat that covers the butt and makes you feel like you are wrapped in a duvet sure is cosy at -27°C! 

I wish we had coats for the sheep, though of course they would never wear them. I put some more straw out where they were laying this morning and they got oats this morning and tonight, so hopefully they stay warm enough. The chicken coop has cooled off, but so far it is still a little above 0°C. We did have to rescue a chicken from under the front steps. It seems she headed out there when Chris had the coop door open during today's cleaning, and then just decided to hunker down and wait for summer. While I am usually supportive of letting animals make their own choices, in this case we hustled her back to the coop. I did notice that she is the same chicken who suffered the very bad frostbite during the first cold snap of the winter, and now I know why. No sense! Unfortunately in addition to spending some time shivering, she also missed out on the head of lettuce all the other chickens got to attack while she was waiting to be rescued.

Today's photo is from this day last year, but really it could be from almost any winter day here. Although right now Seuss's frisbee is orange. 

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
