Hi,

A much quieter day than yesterday. I was away for part of the day at the dentist. No new cavities, which was a relief as I had quite a few filled last time! While it was not quite as warm as yesterday, it was still very nice and the chickens spent most the day out and about. As far as we know there were no aerial visitors, so hopefully the goshawk has moved on.

Today's photo is of the chickens spending time foraging in the compost. Luckily for us our rooster does not seem to be the jealous type!

Hugs,<break />
