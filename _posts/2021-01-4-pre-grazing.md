Hi,

It has been a busy 24 hrs in the animal care department. The temperature really plummeted last night, too fast for our coop heater to keep up. So, at 2:45 am while Chris was putting a second heater in the coop, I went out to check on the sheep and give them some oats. Everyone survived until morning, thought I think Chris and I are a little worse for wear and lacking in the sleep department. After watching the sheep, I realized that they have to work quite hard to pull hay from the round bale. The outside layer seems quite solid in spots, and when I peel off sections for them they eat with great enthusiasm. With the cold temperatures, I don't want them having to work to eat, or having to leave their sheltered spot to stand in the wind to eat either. So, this afternoon and evening found me arm deep in the round bale, "pre-grazing" for the sheep by pulling out flakes of hay and piling it by where they seem to sleep. Although the temperature is warmer tonight, only -23°C so far, the windchill is currently -34°C. In fact, we had to block off one of the vents in the gable of the chicken coop as the wind was blowing right in and making it quite drafty. With this in mind, I also stacked up some straw bales to create a windbreak for the sheep. I hope they are enjoying their little sleeping nook!

Unfortunately our bathtub is occupied once again for the evening. This time our guest is one of the leghorns who appears to be the victim of feather picking. Over the last few days we noticed she had a few feathers pulled out and there was a bit of blood, so we decided it was time to bring her inside for a closer look. Someone is definitely pulling out and breaking off the feathers near the base of her tail. Poor girl! After some soaking to remove the dried blood and a generous spray of iodine, she is now drying off and resting in the tub. Time for us to spend some time on the internet seeking advice about how to remedy this new chicken husbandry challenge.

Today's photo is from our midday walk, the warmest part of the day. I spotted this perfect little nest as I was stopped to wait for Sadie to catch up. Between watching the dogs to make sure they aren't heading off on their own solo walk, and paying attention to where I put my feet so I don't end up on my butt, I'm sure I miss a lot of the finer details of the forest. I am glad I got to see this one! I can also report that I walked past the tree where I saw the mushroom last week, and it is still there.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
