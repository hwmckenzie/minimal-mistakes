Hi!

I had good intentions of writing the daily yesterday, but sometimes intentions are not enough! It was overall a very odd day. I started out the morning with the dog walk as usual, but then decided to splash out and enjoy a second cup of coffee (and more cinnamon buns then I am willing to admit to in writing here!). It has been a long time since I've done the double coffee, and I was reminded it was for a good reason! By noon I was vibrating internally at a cellular level. At that point all you can really do is wait for your body to process the caffeine and generally try to ride it out. Needless to say, I've (re)learned my lesson and I won't be doing that again for a while! I also discovered a major setback to my egg muffin sale plan yesterday. While you can sell uninspected eggs from your farm, you cannot sell any products made with your uninspected eggs. So my egg muffin idea is not legal. I guess I'll have to keep my day job after all.

I think I am still experiencing the caffeine aftereffects today, as things continued to feel unsettled. Work is meh. Training with Seuss went right off the rails.... mostly due to an over-enthusiastic Hannah who wanted to try "just one more thing!". I think I may have seriously set us back. I threw in the towel in the dinner department and we had frozen pizza. And, I saw a news article about Heartland, the only TV show I've ever followed, which shared some big and sad news about their season premier. So of course, after consultation with my fellow Heartland fan, I decided I had to watch it and I am now emotionally recovering. I sure hope tomorrow is a bit more mellow!

Today's photo is of Seuss demonstrating a wonderful sit and stare alert to let me know where his dinner was. So I know he can do it, but how to communicate that to him?

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
