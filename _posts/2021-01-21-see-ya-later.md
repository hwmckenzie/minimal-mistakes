Hi,

A short note tonight. For one thing, it is late! For another, we went to Vegreville this afternoon, so there was no evening dog walk, not much time spent on property things, and so not many stories. The dogs are feeling a bit blue due to the lack of a second walk, so we'll have to try spice things up for them a bit tomorrow. The chickens are riding high tonight though. One of the reasons for our trip was to conclude the sale of three dozen eggs, to a stranger! This was an exciting sale as it elevated us a little from the status of kids selling lemonade in their front yard to kind neighbors who feel bad for them! Hopefully she is a repeat customer.

Today's photo comes from the trail camera on our driveway. We recently swapped out the card and came across this little gem. A flashback to when the sheep went on the lamb. Here they are at the start of their journey, kicking up their heels as they head down our driveway in search of greener pastures.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
