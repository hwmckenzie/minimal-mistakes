Hello!

Well, after a good weekend, this morning I returned to work at my home office. The commute from the kitchen was pretty quick and I only had a bit of traffic congestion upon arrival as some of the dogs had chosen to lay behind my chair. The problem with the quick commute is that the trip back is equally quick in case you forgot your cookies... or already ate them... or didn't bring as many as you wished you had! In addition to receiving "Designer" privileges for the SharePoint site that I am setting up for our team (SharePoint is an online collaborative workspace), I successfully made naan to go with our curry tonight. The naan was considerably easier to make than the SharePoint is turning out to be, and while I never second guessed my idea to take charge of making the naan, the same cannot be said of the SharePoint!

Today's photo was taken by Chris on our morning walk. All present and accounted for, except for Seuss who was likely out in front trying to convince me to throw his frisbee.

Hugs,
Hannah
