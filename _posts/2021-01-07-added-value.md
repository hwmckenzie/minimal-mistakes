 Hi,

 As I write this I have just taken a batch of egg muffins out of the oven. These are basically mini quiches, but without the crust. Just some veggies, cheese, and sometimes meat, in muffin tins with eggs poured on top and cooked for 20 minutes. We eat them straight away, or put them in the freezer and then heat them up in the microwave for a quick breakfast. The eggs muffins are part of my campaign to eat more eggs. It is strange to think back to our pre-chicken days when we might have had one carton of eggs in the fridge. Now it is a challenge to keep it below six dozen! In fact, it was Chris asking me if he should start another row for the eggs in the fridge that prompted tonight's egg muffin baking. I used to consider muffin recipes that called for three eggs to be very extravagant. Now I routinely put three eggs in every time I make muffins, no matter what the recipe calls for! 

 I just took the egg muffins out of the oven and they look so tasty! I wondered to myself what someone might pay for one of those tasty little bites? Chris thought maybe he'd pay a dollar. It seems like the market could support this price as Tims sells two "egg bites" for $3.49. And they are smaller than mine. And of course I would make more flavour combinations! So for a little extra work and about one cup of toppings we might be able to turn a dozen eggs we'd be hard pressed to sell for $5 into a $12 product. I am starting to see the benefit of added value! I suppose that conversion only works if there are buyers. I expect we might have some local buyers, but I'm not too sure how to go about connecting with them, and helping them see how egg muffins could improve their lives. Perhaps the first step is to give away some egg muffins to a few friends and gather some feedback. They do tend to be a little wet upon reheating, so maybe there is some room for further research and development. Good thing I have a personal in-house tester!

Today's photo is from our evening walk. Again, the light is just amazing! I don't remember January evenings being so lovely in previous years. Maybe they have always been like this and I just haven't gotten out to enjoy them? Or maybe in previous years it has been -20C on most January evenings instead of the balmy -5C we have been having. Not to mention that in previous years at this time of day I would have been commuting home from the office, thus being deprived of this beauty. Cheers to working from home!

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
