Hello to all!

Today I ventured out into the world beyond our house! I had to go in to work to receive the delivery of my van, which I use in the summer to chauffeur Seuss around to his inspection stations. It is a white mini van, and from peering through the windows it appears that the first row of back seats will not fold down into the floor as in previous years, which means I have just inherited a couch for my office over the summer! I can't say much more about the van at the moment as it is self-isolating to ensure it isn't harboring any covid-19 germs from previous drivers.

I just came back inside from what has become a nightly routine of going out onto the deck and listening at about 8 or 9 pm. A few nights ago, for two nights in a row, Chris and I heard what sounded sort of, but not exactly, like a goose honking. On the third night I decided to try to record it and send it to one of the biologists I work with who is an avid birder in the hopes of solving the mystery. Unfortunately it was so windy that night, I couldn't hear anything but cold air rushing past my ears. And the last two nights, nothing! Two days ago while on my evening walk I did see a solitary goose flying overhead, so perhaps it really was a goose? But I am skeptical. I will continue to investigate and report any further nightly noises.

Today's photo is of some critical supplies I picked up during my trip to the outside world. I've heard that liquor stores in other provinces have closed, so I am feeling lucky that the liquor stores in Alberta are still open!
