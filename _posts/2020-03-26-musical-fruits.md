Hi there,

It was nice to be back at the home office today. Although it was a bit gray at times, the day ended quite warm (+3C!) and sunny, so the dogs and I enjoyed our walk. Revi and Sadie embraced the spring weather by burrowing most of their bodies under the snow in search of mice. Thankfully to no avail! For dinner I made red beans with sausage in the instant pot. As I tell Chris routinely, it was "experimental". Well, I didn't realize how variable beans could be in levels of done-ness when all cooked in the same pot! Some were nice and soft, but we discovered quite a few crunchy ones... We are still waiting to see if there will be any....errrrrr, after effects! A tasty dish though, but I'll cook it for a few extra minutes next time!

The photo today is of us and Revi enjoying a bit of a post dinner lounge in our hammock, which we dusted off for the first time this year. We were laying around on the couch, wondering what to do, so we decided to go lay outside on the hammock instead. Revi didn't think much of all the laying around, as she only has attention for squirrels these days!

Many hugs,
Hannah
