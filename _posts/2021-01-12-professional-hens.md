Hi,

Well, I think the caffeine and its after effects have completely cleared my system as I am feeling much more stationary today! A big relief. I also got out of the house which probably helped a lot as well. Seuss and I went on a field trip to Vegreville to use the dog wash services at the local Pet Value. It is a do-it-yourself wash, but they have really great tubs that don't require me to bend over, and when Seuss shakes, cleaning up the water is not my problem! Now he smells great and is (hopefully) less itchy. He even has leave in conditioner! Quite a pampered shepherd.

The chickens had a big day today as they sold their first dozen eggs (other than the eggs I sold to my wonderfully supportive boss over the summer). They may also have a new customer, inquiries are being made on their behalf. This is lucky for us as they laid another eight eggs today! I thought they would slow down in the winter, but they seem to be picking up speed. Maybe it is because it has been really mild and they are able to be outside for most of the day. It will be a rude awakening when it finally gets truly cold, which I know it will eventually, even though I wish it wouldn't. With their new-found legitimacy as egg producers, we had to investigate the rules around selling eggs. So far we haven't been washing our eggs. When a chicken lays a egg, they add a coating called "the bloom" that protects the egg against harmful bacteria. However, according to our provincial rules, we have to wash the eggs and dip them in a really dilute bleach solution. Since we don't want to risk getting anyone sick, we are following the rules. This does add some extra steps to our chicken routine though. Chris found an automated egg-washer online. It cost upwards of $2000, but could wash 2000 eggs/hour! I think we'll stick with good old fashioned manual egg washing.

Today's photo is of one of our hens pacing around on our front deck like she owns it. Too bad there are some undesirable bags of refuse in this otherwise rustic winter scene! The homeowners have a few chores piling up it seems.

Hugs,<br />
Hannah
