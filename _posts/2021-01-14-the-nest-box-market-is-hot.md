Hi,

The wind continued overnight and things were quite gusty this morning as we set out for our walk. Before we could leave we had to track down the lid to the recycling can. Luckily it left some distinctive tracks in the snow, and Chris was able to locate it under one of our numerous caragana bushes. No recycling escaped as far as we could tell.

The chickens didn't poke their heads out of the coop until later in the afternoon when the wind died down. And they only laid three eggs today. Perhaps they are still recovering from yesterday's experience of getting stuck outside temporarily in the blowing snow. It might also be that there is contention for the egg layer spot. Although I did build them a nest box with two laying spots, they have shunned it for a while now, preferring instead to lay their eggs on the ground under their roost. While this is a private spot, it is very hard to reach for us humans to collect the eggs. Also, they all seem to want to use the same spot, which presents a problem as one of the hens is slightly broody, so sometimes there is a lineup to get in as she won't get out! In an effort to remedy this situation, today we did a bit of re-organizing of the nest box setup. There are now two nest boxes on the ground, in a slightly easier to access location. We'll see what reviews we get about this tomorrow. Certainly the chickens were not impressed while we were doing it as they were trying to go to bed. The rooster made me laugh. While all the hens were jostling and quarreling to get the best roost for the night, the rooster was hunkered down with his head down and tail relaxed, ignoring them all. As Chris says, he likes to pack it in early!

Today's photo is of the sheep. It is a bit blurry as I really had to zoom in to take it. I did investigate this afternoon to see if they used their shed yesterday during the high winds. While there is evidence they used their "front porch" (a wind break we set up using straw bales), I saw no disturbance or poop in the straw inside the shed itself. However, at least they went into the porch. Baby steps with these sheep! And for most of the day they were hunkered down just east of the shed, which is much closer than normal, so maybe they are considering it.

Hugs,<br />
