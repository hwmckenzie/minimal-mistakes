Hello,

Well, it turns out that today was what I would call a Mundane Monday. We did all our usual activities: breakfast, dog walk, coffee, work, lunch, work, dog walk, dinner... which we will repeat tomorrow. And they were all fine. But wrack my brain as I might, no suitable anecdote comes to mind to share. Well, maybe one does after all. While living with Jen in Edmonton, we would sometimes listen to John Denver. I often think of one particular line: "some days are diamonds, some days are stone". Well, I would say today was of the more humble stone variety!

I was also at a loss for a photo to share, but while staring into space in my efforts to compose this note, my gaze fell upon the subject of tonight's photo. For Christmas in 2018 I bought a poinsettia. Despite my lack of faith that poinsettias could survive in a pot for any real amount of time, and I'll admit efforts to "forget" it outside in inclement weather, Chris nurtured it and we enjoyed its blooms this winter. Lately it has started looking a bit forlorn. We're not quite sure what it needs, but as I looked at it tonight, I felt I could relate. It's still cheery, but a bit ragged around the edges and in need of some warmer weather (and perhaps a bigger pot?).

Big hugs tonight,  
Hannah
