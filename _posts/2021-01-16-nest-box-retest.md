Hi,

The mild weather continues here. We enjoyed +3째C today. Certainly nice weather for having a campfire and roasting hotdogs, which we did for lunch. And the perfect weather for deep cleaning the chicken coop, which we also did. But it is starting to feel almost eerie. Normal temperatures for this time of year are a maximum of -9째C and a minimum of -19째C. In fact, on this day last year we were experiencing -39째C! I expect the other winter boot will drop soon enough, and I'm not sure if that will make me feel better or worse!

As part of the big chicken coop clean we also completed some upgrades. The chickens laid five eggs today. All on the floor at the back, right in front of where they used to lay them before yesterday's failed attempt at new nest boxes. It was like they were sending us a message: "give us our egg laying nook back!" So, while Chris took on the sizable task of coop cleaning, I fashioned some new nest boxes (in consultation with the internet) which will hopefully be more suitable. We now have four options for egg-laying locations in order to reduce congestion. The boxes are on the floor and private, both of which were on the chicken's "must have" list. They are contained, which will hopefully mean the clean shavings stay in and the dirty shavings stay out, which was one of our conditions. The cleaning and renovations took a little longer than expected, so we had some agitated chickens gathered around the door waiting to get back in their coop by the time we were done. However, it was satisfying to watch them check out the new nest boxes. Hopefully this is a good omen for their acceptance and use of them for tomorrow's eggs!

I also took some time today to write a new post for the [Property Report](https://propertyreport.upnix.com) talking about a new direction I am taking it in.

Today's photo is of the new chicken coop arrangement. In fact if you look closely you can even see a chicken in one of the new nest boxes in the photo!

Hugs,<br />
