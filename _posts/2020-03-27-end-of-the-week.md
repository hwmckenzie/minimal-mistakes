Hello!

It is Friday night here at the property. All the dogs are snoozing on their beds, and I expect that Chris and I are going to follow suit quite soon. No big plans for the weekend yet, but I guess you'll hear about whatever happens tomorrow!

The photo for today is of some paw prints we saw on our walk. Based on the fact that they are exiting our yard, I am guessing that the dogs' kingdom is being invaded when they aren't looking. Perhaps that explains why Seuss often bursts out the door at top speed! We can only hope that the fox (I suspect this is what it is) has come to take care of our pigeon problem in the barn!

Hugs, and I hope everyone is well,
Hannah
