Hi,

Well, it's here. The final day of the holidays. I think I am feeling neutral about it. I have enjoyed my time off, and I would enjoy more days off. But going back to work will be ok too, and it has to happen sometime. So it might as well be tomorrow, right? I made some cinnamon buns this morning so I have something to look forward to when I take my coffee to my desk in the morning.

Despite our best efforts, Revi is now fourth on the local dog leaderboard for active minutes. Considering she's gotten two walks everyday this month (two of which were over an hour long!), I'm not sure if we can do much better. We must be surrounded by overachieving dogs.

The sheep are all set for the rest of the winter hay-wise. We rolled the second bale into their pen today and I set up what I hope is a new and improved hay delivery system. I wrapped it in the snow fence again, but this time I also added a tarp on top. Hopefully this will forestall them jumping on top of it, which definitely shortened the life of the first bale. The new setup did make for some concerned sheep with much jumping and fleeing, but they did eventually figure out it was just their food wearing a hat! They also got some time in the yard today, and much to our dismay, they have started investigating the gate. I guess their little outing left quite the impression as they seem eager to repeat it. Not a feeling I share!

Today's photo is of a rose hip in winter. The evening light on our dog walks is so pretty that even an amateur like myself can take an artsy photo on an iphone!
